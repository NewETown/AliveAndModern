          <h2>What is Alive and Modern and why should I care?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><strong>Alive and Modern</strong> is a new company that combines the best elements of nature and modern design to create stunning visuals for any room or office. We are starting out with a few different desktop-friendly aquariums, fountains, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wall" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">living walls</a>. Each piece is designed to bring a natural, wild feel into any room regardless of light levels, space, and room layout.</p>
          <p><strong>Why should you care?</strong> Great question! Let me help you understand the benefits of live plants, flowing water, and why you <i>want</i> to bring nature into your home and workplace. There are many studies about <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/023512_plants_NASA_employees.html" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">live plants</a> increasing your <a href="http://earth911.com/news/2013/03/18/5-reasons-to-have-a-plant-at-your-desk/" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">productivity, air quality, and aesthetic</a> at work. Some plants are <a href="http://workdesign.co/2013/04/7-great-plants-for-your-office/" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">better than others</a> but, at the end of the day, <a href"http://www.ambius.com/learn/benefits-of-our-services/" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">all plants</a> will benefit you and your environment in one way or another. I want to make it as easy as possible for you to reap these <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/od/termsandtables/a/aquariumhealth.htm" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">benefits</a> while creating something that sets your room or office apart from the rest. This is where the aquarium portion comes in. Technically the open-top tank design with the waterfall could be considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paludarium" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">paludarium</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparium" target="_blank" style="target-new: tab;">riparium</a>. These are typically reserved for advanced hobbyists with years of aquarium experience under their belt. I think that's ridiculous! These kinds of designs look great and, when designed properly, are very easy to maintain.</p>
          <p><strong>So what's the catch?</strong> There really isn't one. I've designed these structures to be as low maintenance and cost-effective as possible. Highlights include:
            <ul>
              <li>LED lighting (powerful and energy effecient).</li>
              <li>No smell and no filters to clean; the water in these aquariums and fountains is naturally cleaned by the live plants.</li>
              <li>Easy maintenance. All you have to do is keep the plants trimmed and, if you have an aquarium, feed the fish.</li>
            </ul>

          <p><strong>The short version</strong>: I love modern design philosophy (with respect to technology, architecture and interior design) and I love aquariums so I decided to put the two together.</p>
          <p><strong>The long version</strong>:I grew up building aquariums with my dad; I believe I finished my first little fish tank when I was about four years old. I was constantly building new aquariums, tearing down or modifying old ones, and begging my parents to let me put "just one more" in my room because I absolutely had to have that other species that wasn't compatible with my current tank. As I grew older my taste evolved. I went from the standard plastic decorations with rocks that look more like candy sprinkles than any kind of substrate to more natural-looking aquariums. I also shifted from aquatic setups to terrariums, typically housing poison aarow frogs and other terrestrial exotics.</p>
          <p>A similar shift happened with my appreciation for architecure and interior design. I think this sort of maturing happens with everyone; after college I started to appreciate nicer clothes, rooms that were designed well, and houses that stood out from the norm in one way or another. I started reading GQ, Esquire, and other mens magazines as I transitioned from a teenager to an adult; basically I wanted nicer things. Enter a new appreciation for various design philosophies. One in particular, modern design, captured my interest more than the others. I decided that my new apartment would need to be as modern as I could make it; I picked out a low-frame bed, crisp furniture and borrowed some ideas from an issue of GQ that outlined how to design a modern room. I had accent walls and all kinds of things I never thought I'd care about before; it made my apartment stand out from the apartments my friends were setting up.</p>
          <p>I've been in my apartment for about five months now and still enjoy the way it's laid out however I haven't been able to incorporate my terrariums with the rest of my layout. The fundamental problem I've run into is the cages themselves don't jive with the rest of my room. They look great, the plants are growing like crazy, the frogs are happy, everything about the contents of the terrariums is exactly where I want it but the look just isn't there. This is the catalyst I've been waiting for. This is the thing I want to do that I can do better than anyone else.</p>
